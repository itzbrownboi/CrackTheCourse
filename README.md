# CrackTheCourse 🎓

CrackTheCourse is a web application that connects university students with tutors offering help in specific courses. Tutors can list the classes they teach, and students can search for help based on their weak subjects — all from a clean and user-friendly interface.

Live Demo: [https://crackthecourse.onrender.com](https://crackthecourse.onrender.com)
